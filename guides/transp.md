# Transparant Texture

![Texture examples](/assets/transp1.png)

When required you can place the purple crosshatch texture found within the texture sheet onto a surface, this will create a transparent side. 

If you want to create the same effect but allow projectiles to pass, use the yellow cross hatch texture.

Note these will still block player movement but as shown below, do not render as visible in game.
