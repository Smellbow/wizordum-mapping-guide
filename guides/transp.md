# Transparant Texture

![Texture examples](/assets/transp1.png)

When required you can place the purple crosshatch texture found within the texture sheet onto a surface, this will create a transparent side. 

If you want to create the same effect but allow projectiles to pass, use the yellow cross hatch texture.

Note these will still block player movement.
