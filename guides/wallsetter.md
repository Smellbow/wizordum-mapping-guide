## Wall Layer Setters (up/down)

Wall setters are pretty versitile and allow you to work outside the apparant restrictions you might encounter when designing play spaces / buildings. You will find them under the "actors" menu.

Normally if your ground floor was on the middle editor 'level', you would be restricted to building three full blocks above that level.

Wall setters allow you to exceed that limitation when desired, the same goes for below the lowest level using the "down" variant.

Here we place an extra row of blocks along the top level of our wall example.

Now we place Up wall layer setters on those blocks and configure their parameters for movement, Up and Forward.

Shift + Q, E will rotate the direction for the forward movement. 

Highlight a wall setter and use : 
C = forward movement adjust
X = Upward movement adjust

Here we are saying, when the map loads I want you to move up one more space and move forward one space.

When a map loads wall setters activate. So here on map load we see those blocks move up and ontop of the wall, above the editor limit!
