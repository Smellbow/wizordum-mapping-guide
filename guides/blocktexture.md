## Set a texture on blocks whilst placing

When you place new blocks they will have the default brick texture.

If you are placing lots of blocks and then want them to all be a rock texture or other, it can be a pain to go aroud painting them all after placing. It is posible to speed this up by texturing one block then highlighting it with the block tool and pressing "Shift + right click". The next block placed will start with the copied blocks textures.
