## Barrel Ride

Barrel rides work in the manner as minecarts, Place the barrel ride actor and connect it in sequence to nodes. The Barrel will follow the node path and "eject" the player at the last node.

As with minecarts the last node can be added to by connecting another node, This will be where the player hops to when the ride ends.
