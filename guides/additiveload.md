## Additive Load

You can load another map file into a current map file. So perhaps you have a complex building you want to repeat, rather than rebuild it all you can transplant it from one map to another.

In the map which you want to copy INTO, Right click in the center of the space you wish the added part to appear.

In this example I have a second map that contains a simple U shape wall.

After right clicking the center of the map to load INTO, select the map holding the parts to copy, hold "SHIFT" and click load.

The selected map is loading into the current map.

You can undo this by re-loading the current map if you make a mistake before saving, There is a little trial an error in getting used to the paste mechanic!

Be aware that the entire other map is loading in doing this so its best to work in smaller parts or planned merges! :)
