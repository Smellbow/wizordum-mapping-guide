Teleporters... teleport the player. No surpirse there.

Hovering a teleport and pressing "X" will set it to "Off". This will not teleport the player until you trigger it to toggle to on. This can be done via most any other actor that can send a signal. Player triggers, switches etc.

The directional arrow at the bast of the teleport will be the direction the player is facing when the arrive at the destination.

Selecting a teleport actor and pressing "TAB" will open the ambient settings, so you can adjust the ambients of a map on teleport.
