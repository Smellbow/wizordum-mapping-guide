## Why This Guide Exists

The official Wizordum development documentation is already an excellent foundation, and this guide isn't here to reinvent the wheel. Instead, it's designed to **supplement** that documentation with practical nuances, real-world examples, and helpful tips from the community.

Whether you're a first-time mapper or a seasoned tinkerer, this guide aims to bridge gaps—clarifying what's unsaid, sharing discoveries, and offering insights born from hands-on experience. Think of it as a community companion to the dev docs.
