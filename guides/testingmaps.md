## Testing your map shortcuts

Whilst pressing the play icon will run the map from the player start point there are a couple of other options.

Pressing shift and then clicking play will present options to select a character and difficulty to run the map on.

Also pointing to an area in the editor and pressing "Ctrl + T" will run the map from that position, great for testing certain areas without having to run the whole map or move the player start.
