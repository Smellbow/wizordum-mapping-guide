## Minecarts

The minecart actor, as youd expect, creates rideable minecarts.

Like wall towers, a minecart can be connected to node actors in sequence to form its "track". Thse can change height. Note the player will be ejected at the last node. Once a minecart reaches its last node, it can be used again to go back to the first.
