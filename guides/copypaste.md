You can move a section of your map around with a cut paste feature.

You must do this in 1st Person mode (F1 to toggle)

Draw a box using the floor tool whilst holding "V" (or "C") to cover the area you wish to copy and press right click on your mouse before letting go of "V"

Now point to the space you wish to copy the area to and press "Shift + P" to paste to that spot. The area potinted to will be the lower left corner of the selection.
