## Wall swapping

Wall movers can be used to make textures appear to "swap out". Your imagination is the limit here but one simple example is the player lighting a fireplace.

Above we have a simple wall with an unlit fireplace texture on one wall. Behind it we have another block textured as the lit fireplace. Also laid out we have an invisible button and two wall movers.

Above we set the movers up so they will move the needed number of blocks in distance and set the speed to "INST" (Instant)
